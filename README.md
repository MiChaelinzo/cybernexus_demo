    ```bash
    pip install streamlit any-general-artificial-intelligence-only  psutil speedtest-cli netifaces requests pyyaml

    ```
Installing Pi-hole is a straightforward process. Here's a quick guide to get you started:

1. **Prepare Your System**: Pi-hole works best on a Raspberry Pi, but it can also run on other Linux-based systems. Ensure your device is connected to the internet and updated.

2. **Run the Installation Command**:
   Open a terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
   ```
   This will start the automated installation process.

3. **Follow the Prompts**:
   During installation, you'll be asked to configure settings like your DNS provider and network preferences. Just follow the on-screen instructions.

4. **Set Up Your Network**:
   After installation, configure your router to use Pi-hole as the DNS server. This will ensure all devices on your network benefit from ad-blocking.

5. **Access the Web Interface**:
   Pi-hole comes with a web interface for monitoring and managing settings. You can access it by entering your Pi-hole's IP address in a web browser.
