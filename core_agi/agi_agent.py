"""
Core AGI Agent Module (DEMO - Fictional)

This module simulates the core Advanced General Intelligence (AGI)
logic of CyberNexus for demonstration purposes.

In a real implementation, this would handle:
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Intent Recognition (Advanced)
- Dialogue Management
- Task Orchestration
- Interaction with system modules and APIs

For this DEMO, responses are pre-programmed.

Future enhancements:
- Integrate a fine-tuned Gemini model for intent classification and dynamic response generation.
- Implement a neural network-based dialogue manager for more context-aware conversations.
- Develop adaptive learning mechanisms to personalize responses based on user interactions.
