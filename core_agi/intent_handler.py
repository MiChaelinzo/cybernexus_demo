Intent Handling Module

This module would, in a real CyberNexus implementation, handle:
- Advanced Intent Recognition from Natural Language Prompts
- Mapping Intents to Specific Actions/Functions
- Context Management for Conversational Flow

Future Enhancements:
- Implement a dedicated intent classification model (e.g., using NLP techniques).
- Create a flexible intent mapping system (e.g., using configuration files or a rule-based engine).
- Develop context tracking to handle multi-turn conversations and complex user requests.
"""

# In this DEMO, intent handling is largely handled in get_ai_response_demo and main app script.
# In a more advanced demo or real application, this module would contain functions
# to perform more sophisticated intent classification and routing.

# Example of a potential future intent handling function (not used in this demo):
def classify_intent(prompt):
    """
    Classifies user intent from a natural language prompt.

    In a real implementation, this would use an NLP model.
    For this demo, it's a placeholder.
